# CircleCollider
2D Collision detection.

## Description
This is a rudimentary game where a dot spawned at the top left can be moved around the map. The only obstacles are another dot and a rectangular wall.
The code uses a basic implementation of collision detection between 1) Circle and Circle, 2) Circle and Rectangle.

## Usage
To directly run the game, simply double-click on CircleCollider.exe in `/bin/x64/Debug/`.
